This is my attempt to build a sortable table using React. Currently, the user can input a new row and delete it. I face several challenges when attempting to create the row in-line edit and the sort functionality. 
1) First, the user needs to input their name, and the application will promptly proceed to the main page.
2) Then, the user can create and delete the row(s).
